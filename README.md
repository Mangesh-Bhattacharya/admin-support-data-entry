# Admin Support – Data Entry Tasks

A small project converting unstructured text into clean, well‑formatted CSV spreadsheets to demonstrate accuracy, consistency, and attention to detail in data entry work. It demonstrates the ability to:

- Convert unstructured text into clean, structured tables  
- Maintain accuracy and consistency  
- Organize files clearly so that clients can quickly review the work  

## Project Overview

The project contains two simple sample tasks:

1. **Customer List Cleanup**  
   - Input: Raw text list of customers with inconsistent formatting  
   - Output: Clean `customers_clean.csv` with standardized columns and values  

2. **Product Catalog Entry**  
   - Input: Raw text list of products with mixed information in each line  
   - Output: Clean `products_clean.csv` ready to be imported into a spreadsheet or system  

These examples are small on purpose so clients can quickly see the quality of the work.

## Folder Structure

- `datasets/raw/`  
  Original example data in a messy, unstructured format.

- `datasets/clean/`  
  Final, cleaned CSV files with proper headers and consistent formatting.

- `documentation/data_entry_process.md`  
  Short explanation of the steps followed to complete each task (how the raw data was read, organized, and checked).

## Python Script

The `clean_data.py` script reads the raw text files, cleans and standardizes the data, and generates the final CSV files in the `datasets/clean` folder.


## Tools Used

- Google Sheets / Microsoft Excel  
- Simple text editor for cleaning the raw text  
- Python (for optional automated cleaning script)
